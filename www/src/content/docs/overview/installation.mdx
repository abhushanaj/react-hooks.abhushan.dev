## Overview

This tutorial provides a quick guide on installing and using the `@abhushanaj/react-hooks` package.

### Installation

To get started, you need to install the package. Use one of the following commands based on your package manager:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="npm">
		<Code code="npm install @abhushanaj/react-hooks" lang="bash" />
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="pnpm">
		<Code code="pnpm add @abhushanaj/react-hooks" lang="bash" />
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="yarn">
		<Code code="yarn add @abhushanaj/react-hooks" lang="bash" />
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Requirements

:::note
The library requires the latest version of **`React (>=18.x.x)`** and **`ReactDOM (>=18.x.x)`** , since it utilizes newly added hooks in React 18.

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="npm">
		<Code code="npm install react@latest react-dom@latest" lang="bash" />
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="pnpm">
		<Code code="pnpm add react@latest react-dom@latest" lang="bash" />
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="yarn">
		<Code code="yarn add react@latest react-dom@latest" lang="bash" />
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::

If you are looking to support **`React (<=17.x.x)`** versions, you will need to provide a polyfill or shim for the following hooks.

1. [`useSyncExternalStore`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useSyncExternalStore) for subscribing and managing external stores. The shim is available [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-sync-external-store).

### Browser support

The library is optimized for modern browsers and is transpiled with **ES6** as output target.

> **Depending on your environment, you might need to add polyfills. If you want to support older browsers, you need to transpile the library from node_modules yourselves**

## Usage

All hooks are named exports, so importing them is straightforward.

1. Import a single hook

   <Code
   	lang="tsx"
   	title="./src/App.tsx"
   	mark={['useDocumentTitle']}
   	code="import { useDocumentTitle } from '@abhushanaj/react-hooks;"
   />

2. Import multiple hooks.

   You can also import multiple hooks at once.

   <Code
   	lang="tsx"
   	title="./src/App.tsx"
   	mark={['useDocumentTitle', 'useToggle']}
   	code="import { useDocumentTitle, useToggle } from '@abhushanaj/react-hooks;"
   />

## Example

```tsx title="./src/App.tsx" ins={2,6}
import React from 'react';
import { useDocumentTitle } from '@abhushanaj/react-hooks';

function App() {
	const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
	useDocumentTitle(`Count: ${count}`);

	return (
		<div>
			<p>Count is : {count}</p>
			<button onClick={() => setCount((prev) => prev + 1)}>Increment by 1</button>
		</div>
	);
}

export default App;
```
