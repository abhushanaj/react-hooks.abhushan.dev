import Example from '@/components/demo/useOnMount';
import { DemoWrapper } from '@/components/demo/wrapper';

The `useOnMount` hook is helpful when you want to run a callback function after the component has mounted. It relies on the `React.useEffect()` hook internally.

<DemoWrapper title="useOnMount">
	<Example client:load />
</DemoWrapper>

:::caution
In React version **18.x.x** and above, when the development mode includes the usage of [`<React.StrictMode/>`](https://react.dev/reference/react/StrictMode) and is enabled, components may undergo a double mounting process. As a result, any callback associated with these components will also be executed twice during this initial mounting.
:::

## Usage

Import the hook from `@abhushanaj/react-hooks` and use in required component;

```tsx title="./src/App.tsx" ins={1,4-6}
import { useOnMount } from '@abhushanaj/react-hooks';

function App() {
	useOnMount(() => {
		console.log('Mounted');
	});

	return (
		<div>
			<p>I am now mounted!</p>
		</div>
	);
}

export default App;
```

## Properties

1. When using the `useOnMount` hook, **you don't need to memoize the callback** with `React.useCallback` or similar. The hook inherently maintains referential stability for the callback. As the callback is not utilized as a dependency in the useEffect, you can pass your callback as is, and rest assured that it will be called only once during the initial mount, regardless of subsequent re-renders.

```tsx title="./src/App.tsx" del={6-8, 10}
import React from 'react';
import { useOnMount } from '@abhushanaj/react-hooks';

function App() {
	// This is not required at all.
	const callback = React.useCallback(() => {
		console.log('Mounted');
	}, []);

	useOnMount(callback);

	return (
		<div>
			<p>I am now mounted!</p>
		</div>
	);
}

export default App;
```
