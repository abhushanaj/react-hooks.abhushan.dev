React Hooks by [@abhushanaj](https://abhushan.dev) is a set of modern, server-safe custom React hooks focusing on super charging your development speeds while working with React.

Find useful reusable abstractions for browser API's, custom utilities to manage states, create and cleanup subscription to external stores or in general encapsulate often repeated business logic.

## Motivation

Creating another hooks library in a sea of existing options on the npm registry may seem redundant at first glance.

However, the motivation behind this project stems from a personal journey of continuous learning and a desire to build something both practical and enduring for myself.

### Learning and Growth

While projects like ecommerce websites or visualizer dashboards are undoubtedly exciting to create, they often fade into the background once completed.

The motivation here is to build something that serves a dual purpose - a tool for daily work and a source of ongoing learning. By diving into the creation of a custom React hooks library, I aim to deepen my understanding of various aspects of creating and maintaining a full fledged libray which I plan to use for my other projects.

### Practical Application

The decision to create a hooks library is rooted in the need for a tool that can be seamlessly integrated into daily work and across different projects. Rather than creating yet another project that might eventually be forgotten, I wanted to craft something that remains relevant and beneficial in the long run.

### Keeping Pace with Change

React, like any technology, evolves over time.

This project is an opportunity to stay current with the changing specifications of React, ensuring that the library is not only functional but also up-to-date with the latest best practices and features.

### Upskilling

This project serves as a platform to enhance skills in various areas.

Leveraging [TypeScript generics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html) for a more robust API, mastering testing with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) for maintaining reliable and well-tested code, and the intricacies of publishing to the npm registry are all aspects that will be explored and honed.

### Documentation Excellence

Creating a full documentation site is not just about showcasing the project but also about cultivating the ability to communicate effectively.

Learning to write comprehensive and clear documentation, coupled with illustrative demos, ensures that the library is not only useful but also accessible to others.

### Growing with Open Source

Beyond personal development, creating and contributing a open source project is a powerful means of growth.

Learning to handle diverse opinions, addressing issues raised by users, and continuously refining the library based on community input all contribute to a richer and more mature skill set.

## Key Features

### Server safe

Hooks are designed to be server-safe, supporting Server-Side Rendering (SSR) seamlessly. Whether you are working with frameworks like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) or [Remix](https://remix.run/), it ensures a smooth integration.

For hooks relying on top browser APIs such as `usePreferredLanguage` or `useLocalStorage`, simply provide a default value during SSR mode, or they gracefully return null as a default.

### Typesafe

All hooks are purely written in Typescript, harnessing the power of generics. This results in strongly typed APIs, contributing to a better Developer Experience (DX) when using the package.

### Tree Shakeable

All hooks are are packaged as ES modules, offering the advantage of minimal import cost for individual functions.

This tree shakeable nature ensures that only the necessary parts of the library are bundled, optimizing the overall performance of your application.

### Interactive Demos

All hooks comes with an interactive demo example. These demos serve as effective illustrations, helping users understand how to integrate and leverage the hooks in their projects.
