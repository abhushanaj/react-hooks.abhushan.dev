## Overview

This tutorial provides a quick guide on installing and using the `@abhushanaj/react-hooks` package.

:::danger[Under development]
The project is not ready to be used and is still under development. Do not try to use the package as hooks have not been published yet. This is just a starter documentation and things are likely to change with time.

### Installation

To get started, you need to install the package. Use one of the following commands based on your package manager:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="npm">
		<Code code="npm install @abhushanaj/react-hooks@latest" lang="bash" />
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="pnpm">
		<Code code="pnpm add @abhushanaj/react-hooks@latest" lang="bash" />
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="yarn">
		<Code code="yarn add @abhushanaj/react-hooks@latest" lang="bash" />
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Importing the hook

All hooks are named exports, so importing them is straightforward.

### Import a single hook

<Code
	lang="tsx"
	title="./src/App.tsx"
	mark={['useDocumentTitle']}
	code="import { useDocumentTitle } from '@abhushanaj/react-hooks;"
/>

### Import multiple hooks.

You can also import multiple hooks at once.

<Code
	lang="tsx"
	title="./src/App.tsx"
	mark={['useDocumentTitle', 'useToggle']}
	code="import { useDocumentTitle, useToggle } from '@abhushanaj/react-hooks;"
/>

## Example Usage

Now that you've installed and imported the hooks, you can use them in your components.

```tsx title="./src/App.tsx" ins={2,6}
import { useDocumentTitle } from '@abhushanaj/react-hooks';
import React from 'react';

function App() {
	const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
	useDocumentTitle(`Current count is: ${count}`, { resetOnUnmount: true });

	return (
		<section>
			<h1>Update document title to show the latest count</h1>
			<button onClick={() => setCount((prev) => prev + 1)}>Increment Count: {count}</button>
		</section>
	);
}
```
