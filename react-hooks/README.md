> The project is under development.

A collection of modern, server-safe custom React hooks to supercharge your React application development.

Find useful reusable abstractions for browser API's, custom utilities to manage states, create and cleanup subscription to external stores or in general encapsulate often repeated business logic.

## Installation

To get started, you need to install the package. Use one of the following commands based on your package manage

```bash
npm install @abhushanaj/react-hooks
```

## Usage

### Import a hook

All hooks are named exports, so importing them is straightforward.

```tsx
import { useDocumentTitle } from '@abhushanaj/react-hooks;
```

### Import multiple hooks.

You can also import multiple hooks at once.

```tsx
import { useDocumentTitle, useToggle } from '@abhushanaj/react-hooks;
```

## Example

Now that youâ€™ve installed and imported the hooks, you can use them in your components.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useDocumentTitle } from '@abhushanaj/react-hooks';

function App() {
	const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
	useDocumentTitle(`Current count is: ${count}`, { resetOnUnmount: true });

	return (
		<section>
			<h1>Update document title to show the latest count</h1>
			<button onClick={() => setCount((prev) => prev + 1)}>Increment Count: {count}</button>
		</section>
	);
}
```

## Project Structure

The project is a monorepo setup created from the `create-turbo` CLI starter contains two main workspaces:

1. `www`: the documentation site for the `@abhushanaj/react-hooks`.
2. `react-hooks`: the actual npm package for `@abhushanaj/react-hooks` which is shipped to npm registry.

## Versioning using changeset

The versioning for the `@abhushanaj/react-hooks` is managed using changeset CLI and adheres to semver at all times.

**Only react-hooks** package follows this versioning system.

Whenever a new change is made on the `react-hooks` workspace a equivalent `changeset` is created using the `pnpm changeset` command. Any additional information for the changes can be added as well during changset creation.

All changesets are then merged into one release server using the `pnpm changeset version` command and published to npm using `pnpm changeset publish` command.

Learn more about changesets from [official repo](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

> Automating this through Github Actions, is planned in future after a major release is achieved.

## Developing Locally

The active branch for development is `develop`. All changes to the project are merged to this branch.

The latest release branch is `main`. All new releases are triggered from this branch and tagged.
