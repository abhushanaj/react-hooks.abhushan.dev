import Example from '@/components/demo/useIsomorphicLayoutEffect';
import { DemoWrapper } from '@/components/demo/wrapper';

The `useIsomorphicLayoutEffect` hook is helpful when you want to have an isomorphic version of an effect which resolves to `React.useEffect` on SRR and `React.useLayoutEffect` on browswers.

This is required as React currently throws a warning when using useLayoutEffect on the server. To get around it, we can conditionally useEffect on the server (no-op) and
useLayoutEffect in the browser.

:::note
You can learn more about this behaviour from the official [React](https://react.dev/reference/react/useLayoutEffect#im-getting-an-error-uselayouteffect-does-nothing-on-the-server) docs.

## Usage

<DemoWrapper title="useIsomorphicLayoutEffect">
	<Example client:load />
</DemoWrapper>

## Usage

Import the hook from `@abhushanaj/react-hooks` and use in required component;

```tsx title="./src/App.tsx" ins={1,4-6}
import { useIsomorphicLayoutEffect } from '@abhushanaj/react-hooks';

function App() {
	useIsomorphicLayoutEffect(() => {
		console.log('Rendered');
	}, []);

	return (
		<div>
			<p>I am now rendered!</p>
		</div>
	);
}

export default App;
```

## API Reference

### Parameters

The signature for the `useIsomorphicLayoutEffect` is exactly same to one provided by `React.useEffect` and `React.useLayoutEffect`.

| Parameter    | Type                                           | Description                                                | Default     |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| callback     | `React.EffectCallback`                         | The callback function to run when the dependencies change. | N/A         |
| dependencies | `React.DependencyList \| undefined` (optional) | An array of dependencies for the effect.                   | `undefined` |

## Return Value

The hook returns `React.useEffect` when window is not defined (or likely undefined) and `React.useLayoutEffect` on the client where window is defined.

As based on different environment (some of them polyfilling window), the results returned can likely provide a false positive, we use the following condition to hopefully determine the environment is window:

```js
// Hopefully the environemnt is window now.
export const isWindow = () =>
	typeof window !== 'undefined' &&
	typeof window.document !== 'undefined' &&
	typeof window.document.createElement !== 'undefined';
```

This is a popular stratergy also used by other popular libraries like [redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/blob/2eac86163be2bd5627dab3e33e8b4e0926895442/src/hooks/useSelector.js#L22-L27).
